            <h2>ATT: Attempts</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Number of attempts to ring in, as given in the box score.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>BCOE: Buzz (Correct) Over Expectation</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of how many additional response attempts a player gains through speed, or
                gains through opponents' lack of speed. This statistic is zero-sum: all positive BCOE
                must be balanced by negative BCOE for another contestant.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>COB: Correct on Buzz</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Correct answers on buzz. Equivalent to COR from the box score, minus any correct Daily Doubles.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>CCON: Contestant Contention</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of the probability that any individual correct response this contestant gave blocked an
                opponent from buzzing in.
            </div>

        <div class="section">

                Daily Doubles found by the player.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>DDOE: Daily Doubles Over Expectation</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of how many more Daily Doubles a player found versus an expectation that each correct
                response in a round is equally likely to lead to finding a Daily Double. This statistic is zero-sum:
                all positive DDOE must be balanced by negative DDOE for another contestant.
            </div>

            <h2>GCON: Game Contention</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of the probability that any individual correct response (for any contestant) block an
                opponent from buzzing in.

            <div class="graph-description">
                Score using only buzz-in responses. Equivalent to actual score and to Coryat score, except
                it ignores Daily Doubles entirely.
