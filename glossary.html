        <h1>Contention Metrics</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                For the purposes of calculating contention metrics, all incorrect responses and all Daily Doubles are
                ignored. This is because incorrect responses do not prevent others from attempting to buzz in after
                the response, and because Daily Doubles are not contended on the buzzers at all. It is true that
                not all attempts to buzz in that are blocked by an incorrect response are reattempted (the incorrect
                response may be the response the blocked contestant intended to give, or they may not wish to
                follow up for other reasons), but in an attempt to quantify and estimate a level of competition, this
                is ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                The base data are then Correct on Buzz, the number of correct responses on buzz-in clues,
                and Blocked Attempts, the number of Attempts minus Correct on Buzz minus Incorrect on Buzz. As an
                example, in <a href="/game.html?season=S38R&game_id=111">S38R Game 111</a>, the base data are: 
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Contestant</th>
                    <th>J! COB</th>
                    <th>J! Blocked</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>Dave Rapp</td>
                    <td>13</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>13</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Carrie Christian</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>11</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hung Pham</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Each contestant is credited with 1 attempt for each COB they actually made, because we know
                for sure this attempt occurred. The blocked attempts for each contestant are allocated
                equally across their opponent's COB. So Dave is credited with 5/10 of an attempt for each COB
                by Carrie or Hung, Carrie is credited with 11/15 of an attempt for each COB by Dave or Hung,
                and Hung is credited with 15/21 for each COB by Dave or Carrie.
                This allocation ignores the possibilities of blocked
                attempts that are not followed up on Triple Stumpers, and it ignores the rare instances of
                double correct responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, we can estimate CCON and GCON. CCON is the probability that any one of
                a contestant's COB responses blocked at least one opponent's attempt. For Dave, in the J! Round, this is:
            </p>
            <p>
                CCON = (11/15) + (15/21) - ((11/15)*(15/21)) = 0.92 = 92%
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that because of the assumptions around Triple Stumpers, the raw CCON calculation can go
                above 100%. In these cases, it is capped at 100%.
            </p>
            <p>
                GCON is the weighted average of the contestants' CCONs, which for the J! Round is:
            </p>
            <p>
                GCON = (13(Dave's CCON) + 8(Carrie's CCON) + 2(Hung's CCON))/(13+8+2) = 0.90 = 90%
            </p>
            <p>
                With the allocations in hand, we can also estimate an expected number of buzzes a contestant
                should have had, continuing to ignore existing incorrect responses and the possibility of further
                incorrect responses. For each of his own buzzes, we estimate an expected value for Dave of:
            </p>
            <p>
                1 / (1 + (11/15) + (15/21)) = 0.409 buzzes
            </p>
            <p>
                But additionally, he has an expected value of buzzing for each of Carrie's buzzes of:
            </p>
            <p>
                (5/10) / ((5/10) + 1 + (15/21)) = 0.226 buzzes
            </p>
            <p>
                And for Hung's of:
            </p>
            <p>
                (5/10) / ((5/10) + (11/15) + 1) = 0.224 buzzes
            </p>
            <p>
                Weighted and combined, this is:
            </p>
            <p>
                13(0.409) + 8(0.226) + 2(0.224) = 7.57 buzzes total
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Dave actually had 13 COB, his BCOE is 13 - 7.57 = +5.43 buzzes.
