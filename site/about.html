                J!ometry is built and maintained by 2021 4-day champion and 2022 TOC qualifier
                <a href="https://j-ometry.com/contestant.html?toc_period_id=TOC2022R&contestant=287">John Focht</a>. The origin
                story is that I realized that the published box score PDFs would be difficult to work with in the long run,
                and so I wanted to make sure there was a spreadsheet or CSV or something that research could be done with, once
                there was enough data. Then it turned out that I wanted to do some of that research and talk about it. It became
                useful to put it all in one stable place and semi-standardize the things I found most interesting. It also
                became part of my TOC prep.
