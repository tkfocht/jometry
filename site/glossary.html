        <h1>Statistics</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Att: Attempts</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Number of attempts to ring in, as given in the box score.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>BuzC: Correct on Buzz</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Correct answers on buzz. Equivalent to COR from the box score, minus any correct Daily Doubles.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Buz$: Score on Buzz</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Score using only buzz-in responses. Equivalent to actual score and to Coryat score, except
                it ignores Daily Doubles entirely. <i>Why not just use Coryat?</i> The earliest version of
                this site was based soley on the box scores, and Coryat is not derivable from them. After that,
                I mostly just decided I liked Buz$ as an in-game contestant statistic better, as it only covers clues available
                to all players. I do believe Coryat is better for comparing performance at home, though.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Contention</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of the probability that any individual correct response (for any contestant) blocked an
                opponent from buzzing in.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>DDF: Daily Doubles Found</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                Daily Doubles found by the player.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>DD+: Daily Doubles Over Expectation</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of how many more Daily Doubles a player found versus an expectation that each correct
                response in a round is equally likely to lead to finding a Daily Double. This statistic is zero-sum:
                all positive DD+ must be balanced by negative DD+ for another contestant.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Solo: Buzzes that are uncontested</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of how many correct responses did not block an opponent's attempt at a correct response.
                That is, it is an estimate of how many clues the contestant alone was correct on.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Timing: Buzzes created through buzzer timing</h2>
            <div class="graph-description">
                An estimate of how many additional response attempts a player gains through good timing, or
                gains through opponents' lack of timing. This statistic is almost zero-sum: most positive Timing
                must be balanced by negative Timing for another contestant, but attempts that are blocked by
                incorrect responses and then not retried on the rebound keep this from balancing exactly.
